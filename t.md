People have been waiting for Cube World's release for two years now. An endless journey on unknown land with action-based combat makes people wait for a reason. However, nobody expected Cube World to suddenly come out on the start of July as alpha version. Does Cube World live with promises or will the alpha version kill all hope for this game?

Hello, gamers! Today I will tell you about an amazing game. It's an experience that people have awaited for the last two years. It's an action-packed adventure with voxels and has surprisingly good gameplay for an alpha! Guess what game it is! Minecraft, perhaps? Good guess, but the correct answer is Cube World, which just got released on PC recently. Speaking of Minecraft, people tend to claim that Cube World is just a massive rip-off of Minecraft. The truth is that the only similarity with Minecraft are the voxels. Cube World focuses on completely different elements.

Cube World is developed by a married German couple, Wolfram von Funck and his wife Sarah. They face a huge challenge: making a dream game which involves infinite adventures, with you in control as a hero. Even after multiple people have offered to help with powerful servers, the couple has chosen to work alone on this project, for unexplained reasons. Will they really be able to do it themselves? I hope this doesn't crash the project!

The developers had no idea just how quickly this game would get immensely popular. Alpha was released in early July, but the servers got overloaded right away. The shop for buying the game was down for two days and, even as I write this article, the shop is still closed. Fortunately, things are getting more stable as time goes on.

But enough of the backstory, let's talk about the game itself. What is Cube World, exactly? It's a world made of cubes and you are there to save the day. Worlds are endless and can be shared with other players via seed number. This also means if you play single player with, say, seed 5037, and then go in multiplayer with the same seed, you spawn in the same area where you left off. This adds more playability to the game, since there are tons of seeds with weird and awesome stuff.

The game also supports infinite levels. However, this doesn't mean that you can become insanely powerful. Your character is balanced by power level, which determines how powerful the gear you equip can be. It increases fast at first, but as you level up more and more, the power level increases more slowly. To get the power level 100, you have to be level 1990\. You think that is hard? Try to get power level 101 - have fun grinding to level 671088535\. Even though power level increases slower, it is good to level up, as your health points continue to increase.

Cube World has a combat that focuses on player skill and free movement. Of course, you are not able to defeat insanely high level bosses at level 3, but in most cases you are able to dodge enemy attacks and strike at the right moment. This is one of the reasons why I like this game; the game rewards you for being a skillful player. It feels great to take down an incredibly difficult boss who throws high damage boomerangs at you all by yourself. I wish enemies wouldn't be so simple though. Bosses would be much better if there would be more special attacks that are deadly if not avoided. I also noticed that only a few enemies actually try to dodge your attacks. Enemies that dodge add more intensity to the battle, and I wish it would be a norm for more difficult enemies.
